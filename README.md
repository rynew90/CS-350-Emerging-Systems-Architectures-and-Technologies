# CS-350-Emerging-Systems-Architectures-and-Technologies


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
```This project was meant to create a thermostat using an embedded system. It required coding the launchpad to be able to adjust the temperature setting using two buttons and and LED light to show the thermostat heating and cooling. The launchpad hosts a temperature sensor that had to be included in the code to be able to accurately determine the ambient temperature around the launchpad.```

What did you do particularly well?

```I was able to code in the buttons and LED light functions well when coding this project.```

Where could you improve?

```I struggled a little in coding in the temprature sensor. Knowing how to do this more easily and efficently would help me in developing embedded systems.```

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

```I am adding the ability to code in embedded C and the knowledge of how to work with PWMs, UARTs, I2C, and GPIOs to my support network. Which will assist me in working with embedded systems later in my educational path and career.```

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

```Being able to code in C will add another coding language to my list of programming languages that I am able to work with, as well as the knowledge of integrating external equipment and devices into applications.```
  
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

```I made this project maintainable by creating it in an object oriented manner by creating methods for specific functions. I made this project readable by including comments to help myself and others who may read the code to understand what each line was created for and how it works. I made the code adaptable by structuring the code in a way that makes any changes that come in later updates easy to implement.```
